 Multi-Class Animal Recognition for Wildlife Conservation

# Abstract

Accurate identification of wild animals in their natural habitat is vital for wildlife conservation and management. The proposed work presents an efficient algorithm to automatically detect and classify animals using images captured by camera traps. Due to the diversity of species and large volumes of visual data, manual identification is both time-consuming and impractical.

This project utilizes a Capsule Network architecture to address these challenges. Capsule Networks are capable of preserving spatial relationships within images, making them well-suited for recognizing animals under various poses and backgrounds. The developed model aims to support key conservation efforts â€” such as preventing animal-vehicle collisions, tracking animal movement, and reducing human-animal conflicts.

Traditional video surveillance generates massive data that demands significant human and financial resources to process. By integrating a deep learning-based approach, this project offers a cost-effective and scalable solution to automatically identify and monitor animals, contributing to smarter and safer wildlife conservation practices.




 # Briefly mention the improvisations done by you:

Organized and prepared a multi-class animal image dataset from various sources, ensuring clean and structured data for training.

Implemented a Capsule Network model in TensorFlow for more accurate recognition of animals compared to standard CNNs.

Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model performance across different environments and poses.

Added image preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization) to enhance input consistency.

Integrated model evaluation and visualization tools (accuracy/loss curves) to monitor training progress and improve results.

Optimized model training with regularization and tuning for better generalization.
