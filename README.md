 Multi-Class Animal Recognition for Wildlife Conservation

 # Briefly mention the improvisations done by you:

Organized and prepared a multi-class animal image dataset from various sources, ensuring clean and structured data for training.

Implemented a Capsule Network model in TensorFlow for more accurate recognition of animals compared to standard CNNs.

Applied data augmentation techniques to improve model performance across different environments and poses.

Added image preprocessing steps (resizing, normalization) to enhance input consistency.

Integrated model evaluation and visualization tools (accuracy/loss curves) to monitor training progress and improve results.

Optimized model training with regularization and tuning for better generalization.
